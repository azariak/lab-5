Sara previously generated her favourite recipe, but
forgot what the ingredients were. She opens the SmartMeal program and 
chooses to load her saved recipes. Her previously saved recipes are displayed 
based on their rank, along with the ingredients, calories, and nutritional benefits 
of each.

Emma needs to meal prep for the week. She opens the meal planning program, selects
her dietary preferences and available ingredients and receives a personalized meal plan with recipes.
